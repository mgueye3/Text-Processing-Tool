# Text Processing Tool

## Description
This Python script provides multiple text-processing functionalities, including:
1. **Removing punctuation** from the text.
2. **Counting words and characters** in a given input.
3. **Checking if a specific word exists** within the text.
4. **Replacing a word** with another user-defined word.
5. **Counting the frequency** of a particular word in the text.

This tool is useful for basic **text analysis, preprocessing, and data cleaning**, which are valuable skills for a **Software Development Apprentice**.

## Features
- Uses Python's built-in `string` module for efficient punctuation removal.
- Handles user input dynamically to process and modify text.
- Implements **modular functions** for easy expansion and maintainability.
- Includes **error handling** to prevent crashes due to incorrect input.
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for user-friendly operation.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter a line of text when prompted.
3. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Remove punctuation from the text.
   - `2`: Count words and characters.
   - `3`: Check if a specific word exists in the text.
   - `4`: Replace a word.
   - `5`: Count the frequency of a word.
   - `6`: Exit the program.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text_processing_tool.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd text_processing_tool
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python text_processing_tool.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Add **support for multiple languages** and character encodings.
- Integrate **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for better text analysis.
- Provide an **export feature** to save results to a file (CSV, JSON, etc.).

## Relevance to Software Development Apprenticeship
- Demonstrates **string manipulation and text processing**.
- Enhances **user interaction through input handling**.
- Implements **modular programming principles**.
- Strengthens **problem-solving skills** through structured functions.
